# [#57] Dockerize Development Environment

> **Labels**: `documentation` `priority:critical` `devops`
> **Assignee**: —
> **Blocking**: [[Issues/Open/[#55] Implement testing strategy for front end typescript components]]

## Description

Create a Docker-based development environment with docker-compose to simplify onboarding and ensure consistency across developer machines.

**Current state**: Production Dockerfiles exist but no dev environment setup.
**Proposed**: `docker-compose.yml` with frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL containers.
**Benefit**: One command (`docker-compose up`) to start developing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` with all services
- [ ] Dev Dockerfiles with hot reloading
- [ ] Database auto-migration/seeding
- [ ] Updated documentation

## Description

Investigate testing strategies from a component level (unit level) to e2e test to ensure robustness across the whole flow. Critically, start with core services/API interactions — where to implement unit-level Jest/Mocha testing and whether a service/system such as Cypress may be useful.
