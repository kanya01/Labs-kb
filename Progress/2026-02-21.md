## ✅ Completed This Week

### Phase 2 — Email & Notification System (DONE)

The entire `epic:email-system` landed across Feb 16–17, closing 11 issues and merging 16 PRs. The system went from zero to fully operational.

**Delivery order (oldest → newest):**

**Feb 16 — Foundation**
- **#79 / PR #90** `feat: Integrate Resend for email delivery, update mailer templates` — Resend configured as the Action Mailer adapter; initial branded templates; email verification scripts. Replaces SMTP to avoid Fly.io port-25 blocking.
- **#80 / PR #91** `feat: Newsletter subscriber model & migration` — `newsletter_subscribers` table with double opt-in fields (`confirmation_token`, `confirmed_at`, `status`).
- **#81 / PR #92** `feat: Newsletter API endpoints & mailer` — `POST /subscribers` (sign-up), `GET /subscribers/confirm` (opt-in link), `DELETE /subscribers/unsubscribe`; `NewsletterMailer` with confirmation + welcome templates.
- **#82 / PR #93** `feat: Footer newsletter subscription form` — Client-side validated form in the footer, wired to the new API via a dedicated API service module.

**Feb 17 — Core Notification System (6 PRs in one day)**
- **#83 / PR #94** `feat: Notification model & migration` — `notifications` table: `user_id`, `notification_type` (12 types), `title`, `body`, `action_url`, `metadata` (JSONB), `read`, `email_sent`, `read_at`.
- **#84 / PR #95** `feat: NotificationService & SendNotificationEmailJob` — Central `NotificationService.notify(...)` entry point; `SendNotificationEmailJob` queued via SolidQueue; `NotificationMailer` fallback; up to 3 retries with polynomial backoff.
- **#85 / PR #97** `feat: Notifications API Controller` — `GET /notifications`, `PUT /notifications/:id/read`, `PUT /notifications/read_all`.
- **#86 / PR #98** `feat: Integrate NotificationService into Order lifecycle` — All direct `OrderMailer` calls in `OrderService` replaced with `NotificationService.notify()`, creating both in-app record and queued email through a single entry point.
- **#87 / PR #99** `feat: Message, earnings & payout notification triggers` — `message_received`, `earnings_available`, and `payout_processed` notification types implemented with email templates.
- **PR #96** `fix: Dockerfile — update system + early connectivity check` — Unblocked deployment.
- **PR #103** `feat: SolidQueue in Puma` — `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA=true` set in `fly.toml`; job queue now runs inside the Rails/Puma process rather than as a separate worker.

**Feb 17 — Frontend Notification UI**
- **#88 / PR #100** `feat: Frontend service layer + TanStack Query hooks` — Typed API client for notifications; React Query hooks for list, mark-read, unread count.
- **#89 / PR #101** `feat: Comprehensive UI notification system` — Notification bell with unread badge in header; full `/notifications` page with notification center.

**Feb 17 — Bug fixes**
- **PR #102** `fix: confirmation page + Resend usage` — Fixed newsletter confirmation page routing.
- **PR #104** `fix: Newsletter URLs → BACKEND_URL` — Mailer and controller URLs use `BACKEND_URL` env var; port numbers standardised.
- **PR #105** `fix: Duplicate API path in newsletter confirmation URL + test` — Prevented double `/api/v1` prefix in confirmation link; added test case.

**Feb 18–19 — Phase 3 start + email polish**
- **PR #106** `feat: User-specific services on profile page` — Profile page now fetches services from the backend API dynamically rather than from mock data. Also updated roadmap section heading. *(Phase 3.1 — hardcoded data)*
- **PR #107** `feat: Migrate order, service, profile fetching from mock → real API` — Major: orders, services, and profile data all migrated from static mock services to backend API calls, with order validation added. *(Phase 3.1 — hardcoded data)*
- **PR #108** `feat: Dynamic email templates for all notification types` — Each of the 12 notification types now has a specific email template with a fallback mechanism; action URLs made absolute.
- **PR #109** `fix: Consolidate DB config to single primary database` + `fix: Add Action Mailbox, Action Text, consolidate Solid Queue/Cache/Cable tables` — Infrastructure cleanup.

### Documentation Restructure (Feb 18)

Commit `213af01` — Docs reorganised from flat files into topic-specific subdirectories (`/docs/email/`, `/docs/services/`, `/docs/admin/`, `/docs/messaging/`, `/docs/design/`, etc.) with new guides introduced. This is the structure now mirrored in this vault under `Docs/`.

## 🔧 In Progress (as of 2026-02-21)

### Phase 3.1 — Hardcoded Data Cleanup

**Branch**: `services_technical_debt_hardcoded_data`

PRs #106 and #107 already landed. Today's commits show the work continuing:

- `95e6187` `refactor: Enhance error handling with unknown types and improve type safety across various components and pages` — Systematic replacement of `any` with `unknown` in TypeScript error handlers across pages and components. Direct work toward closing [[Issues/Open/[#54] Fix failing lint & type checks]].
- `be114eb` `feat: documentation to track linting issues` — Linting violations catalogued for systematic resolution.

The remaining hardcoded data items from [[Docs/services/SERVICES_KNOWN_ISSUES]] (Issues 1–4) are the active focus.
