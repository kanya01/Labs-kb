> Source: [docs/design/SYSTEM_ONTOLOGY.md](https://github.com/kanya01/COLABS/blob/main/docs/design/SYSTEM_ONTOLOGY.md)
> The most comprehensive technical reference in the codebase. 14 entities, state machines, business rules, and data flows.

Complete domain model for the live.o platform. Defines all 14 entities, their relationships, state machines, and core business rules.

## Core Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| User | Core identity; role: Producer / Vocalist / Engineer |
| Profile | Bio, skills, experience level, avatar, location |
| Portfolio / PortfolioItem | Showcase work with audio previews |
| Service | Service listing owned by a seller with tiers |
| ServiceTier | Basic / Standard / Premium; JSONB features list |
| Order | Buyer–seller transaction; drives lifecycle state machine |
| OrderRevision | Revision request/response attached to order |
| Conversation | Direct thread between two users |
| Message | Individual message with read status |
| Notification | In-app event notification (12 event types) |
| Subscriber | Newsletter opt-in with double-confirmation |
| StripeAccount | Seller's Stripe Connect record |
| Payout | Payout request tied to StripeAccount |

## Order State Machine

```
pending → paid → in_progress → in_review → completed
                                    ↑
                              (revision loop — limited by seller)
```

Cancellation and dispute paths also modelled. Revision limits enforced per tier.

---

## Key Business Rules

- A Service has 1–3 tiers (Basic/Standard/Premium), each with its own price, delivery time, revision count, and JSONB feature list
- An Order is always scoped to one buyer and one seller — buyers cannot purchase their own services
- Earnings have a 14-day hold before a seller can request payout via Stripe Transfer
- Each order may have at most one Review (post-completion, buyer to seller)
- Notifications are generated by `NotificationService` which fans out to both in-app record and email job
