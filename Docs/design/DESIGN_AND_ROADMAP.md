# Design & Roadmap — live.o UI/UX

> Source: [docs/design/DESIGN_AND_ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/kanya01/COLABS/blob/main/docs/design/DESIGN_AND_ROADMAP.md)

UI/UX design principles and visual language for the live.o platform.

---

## Design Philosophy

live.o targets a creative, music-industry audience. The visual language is:
- **Dark-first** — dark theme throughout, suited to studio environments and creative tools
- **Motion-rich** — Framer Motion animations for transitions and micro-interactions
- **Clean typography** — clear hierarchy to surface artist names, service titles, pricing
- **Audio-forward** — portfolio audio playback built into cards and profile pages

---

## Design Stack

- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** — page transitions, hover states, animated elements
- **Design tokens** — documented in [[Docs/design/STYLES_AND_CONVENTIONS]]

---

## UI Roadmap Items (Phase 7)

Future polish items (see [[Docs/PLATFORM_ROADMAP]] Phase 7):
- Profile page hero banner redesign
- Audio waveform player / continuous playback bar
- Gig/seller explorer page alignment with design system
- Infinite scroll for listings
- Celebration animation (confetti) on successful bookings
- Mobile responsiveness audit across all pages
