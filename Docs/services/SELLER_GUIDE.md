3. **Connect Stripe** — Complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payouts
4. **Receive orders** — Buyers place orders; seller is notified
5. **Deliver work** — Upload deliverables via Active Storage within agreed timeline
6. **Earn** — Earnings held 14 days then available to withdraw via payout request
