# Buyer Guide — live.o

> Source: [docs/services/BUYER_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/kanya01/COLABS/blob/main/docs/services/BUYER_GUIDE.md)

User-facing guide for buyers on the live.o platform.

---

## Buyer Journey

1. **Discover** — Browse creators at `/discover`, filter by role, experience, or keyword
2. **Explore services** — View a seller's profile and service tiers (Basic / Standard / Premium)
3. **Place an order** — Select a tier, proceed to checkout, pay via Stripe
4. **Track progress** — Order moves through `paid → in_progress → in_review`
5. **Review delivery** — Approve the work or request a revision (within allowed limit)
6. **Complete** — Order marked complete; seller earnings released after 14-day hold

---

## Revisions

Each service tier specifies a revision limit. Buyers can request revisions up to that limit before the order must be accepted.
